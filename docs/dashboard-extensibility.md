## Introduction

Meshery dashboards form a key part of the Meshery UI, providing visual insights and management capabilities. This guide explains the extensibility of these dashboards and how you can customize, integrate, and extend them to suit your needs.

## Architecture Overview

- **Component Structure:** Meshery dashboards are built using modern web frameworks. The UI components are modular and interact with backend services via a well-defined API.
- **Data Flow:** Dashboard components fetch data through REST APIs or real-time data streams, ensuring that the UI remains responsive and up-to-date.
- **Integration Layers:** Custom dashboard components hook into Meshery’s core services, enabling dynamic data binding and interactivity.

## Customization Options

- **Theming:** Modify styles and colors to align with your brand or project requirements.
- **Layout Adjustments:** Customize widget placements and dashboard arrangements.
- **Configuration Files:** Leverage configuration settings to enable or disable features within the dashboards.
- **Plugin Architecture:** Extend functionality by creating plugins that register new dashboard widgets or panels.

## Integration Points

- **APIs:** Utilize Meshery’s REST endpoints to retrieve or submit data.
- **Events and Hooks:** Integrate with the Meshery event system to respond to state changes or user interactions.
- **Extension Registration:** Follow documented patterns to register your custom dashboard component so that it is recognized and loaded by the Meshery framework.

## Step-by-Step Extension Process

1. **Set Up the Development Environment**
   - Ensure you have the latest code from the Meshery repository.
   - Install necessary dependencies using your preferred package manager (e.g., `npm install` or `yarn`).

2. **Scaffold a New Dashboard Component**
   - Create a new component file under the designated directory (e.g., `src/components/dashboards/`).
   - Follow the existing component examples to structure your code.
